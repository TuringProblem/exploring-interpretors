# Question One

1) For the first desktop I went with a DEll OptiPlex 7010 MT mainly for its affordable rate and optimal performance. 
The Dell OptiPlex comes with an Intel Core-i5 13600k (having 14 cores, 5.1GHz 24 MB of shared caching,) having a strong single-threaded performance
while still being affordable when compared to an i9-13900k ($400 cheaper.) It also comes with 32GB of DDR5 RAM (2x16GB,) which offers
quad-channel loading and large memory for high computational tasks. The OptiPlex also comes with 1TB NVMe 4.0 SSD along with a secondary storage of 2TB HDD. 
The graphics card that comes with the OptiPlex is the powerful RTX 4060 with 8GB of virtual memory. With all of these components, this is the perfect computer
for a family desktop, offering high-performance, cost-efficient (around $1,200 - $1,500,) and will last the family over a decade of usability. 

The second workstation is a Dell Precision 7960 Tower Workstation - This powerhouse can come with an Intel Xeon W9-3495x (56 cores, 112 threads, as well as  105MB of caching).
The 7960 also comes with the ability to have up to 512GB of DDR5 RAM (8x64GB,) which comes with Eight-channel memory and Error Correction Code support (Which detects and corrects data transmission in storage).
Dell Precision can also have up to an NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada generation with over 48gb of memory. Although this machine is highly overkill,the tasks this computer executes will feel instantaneuos at the speeds it 
can computate.

The key differences in the Arhcitecture are: System bus, The OptiPlex has a Standard PCIe 4.0 with 16 lanes while the Precision comes with 128 lanes, due to the workstation
needing more for I/O. The memory is also vastly different, although both having DDR5 RAM, the Precision comes with ECC (Error Correction Code) which has advanced memory control compared to the OptiPlex.
The last major difference is in the Interconncections; the OptiPlex uses a standard Intel DMI while the Percision uses an Ultra Path Interconnect (UPI,) which uses directory-based home snoop (Bus snooping,) and provide
coherency protocol with a transfer speed of up to 10.4 GT/s (Transfers per second.) ([DELL](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shopd/desktop-computers/precision-7960-tower-workstation/spd/precision-t7960-workstation/xctopt7960us_vp_cc_fy25?configurationid=e698bb73-7bce-40f2-9370-0ee96ecdaceb))

2) Intel's QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) and AMD's HyperTransport (HT) are competing technologies that are designed to address performance bottlenecking in multicore processes. Intel
deleivered the first QPI in 2008 and it operates at a clock rate of 2.4 GHz - 4.8 GHz, and bit transfers occur on both the rising and the falling edges of the clock, so the transfer rate is double the clock rate.
Intels' QPI, now UPI, has dominated the market, but that does not necessarily entail superiority. QPI offers up to 25.6 GB/s bandwith per direction with 20-bit wide linkes and integrated memory controlers,
while HT provides up to 51.2 GB/s with 2-32 bit wide links and more flexible implementation.

3) MPEG is a group that handles the standards for digital audio, video, 3D Graphics and genomic data. Their are various iterations of MPEG, such as MPEG-1/2 (used in DVDs,) and MPEG-4 which is currently used in streaming.
MP3 which is just MPEG-1 Audo layer III, is an audio compression algorithm designed to reduce the file size while maintaining acceptable quality.
